# data-analysis-on-shopping-using-jupyter-notebook
This data analysis is done on jupyter notebook. The dataset used for this analysis is collected from Kaggle.
Disclaimer: This is not any official data report/analysis. This data analysis is done to demonstrate skills on python(pandas library, numpy arrays, matplotlib) using jupyter notebook.
I have used pandas library techniques to clean and analyze the data. I have used matplotlib to visualize by data analysis. 
Few highlights are buying capacity, best selling category, Top Shopping malls, Purchase method and many more.
